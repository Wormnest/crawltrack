<li>The CrawlTrack tag is a php file, you have to insert it in a .php page.</li>
<li>The CrawlTrack tags have to be between &#60;?php and ?&#62 tags, if there is no such tags on your page, you have to add them before and after the CrawlTrack tag.</li>
<li>If your site is not using .php pages, see documentation on www.crawltrack.net.</li>
<li>For the best anti-hacking protection, have the CrawlTrack tag as the first thing in your page just after &#60;?php.</li>
<li>If you are using any sort of content management script (discussion board, blog, gallery, CMS etc.), have a look on www.crawltrack.net/doccms.php to find the best place to insert the tag.</li>
<li>The CrawlTrack tag will give absolutly no visible output on your pages (even in the source code).</li>
<li>If you would like to support CrawlTrack and see the logo with a link to www.crawltrack.net, you will find logo models below that you can put at any place on your pages.</li>
