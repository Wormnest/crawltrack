Introduction
------------
CrawlTrack will give you a detailed view of the crawler (also called bot or spider)
activity on your website.
Crawler visits counted for more than 85% of hits on www.crawltrack.net. Some are useful,
others not so much or even dangerous (30% were hacking attempts on www.crawltrack.net).
Note: the crawltrack website is not in use anymore. This is a fork of the original
crawltrack script.

CrawlTrack is able to give a clear view of spiders crawling your website and to follow
the indexing of your website from minute to minute.
This knowledge can help you to improve your website ranking in search engine indexes
and through that increase the number of visitors.

CrawlTrack gives you information about the number and origin of visitors, the bounce rate,
the number of 404 errors, the number of file downloads, your server load and your site
indexation.

Besides this CrawlTrack can also block numerous hacking attempts.

Requirements
------------
PHP version 5.3.7 or higher including PHP 7.


License
-------
GNU GPL version 2 or higher.


New installation
----------------
Upload all files in a folder on your website then enter your CrawlTrack url in your
browser and follow the instructions to install CrawlTrack.
The more detailed information on the official website: http://www.crawltrack.net is
now sadly offline.


Upgrade from a previous version
-------------------------------
Upload all new files to your website, taking care not to destroy the crawltrack.php file at the root
of your crawltrack folder and the configconnect.php file in the include folder.
That's all you have to do. As soon as you log in everything needing updates will be
automatically upgraded.

If you are using the second tag (the biggest one with http request) from a version before the 3.0.0,
you need to replace the tag on your page to be able to use that version.
